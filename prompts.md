# Prompts

## 2025-09-29

- rename "rust-docs" to "rust-docs-sidebar"
- when the selected rust symbol is a struct, also show its methods below
- methods are not showing, I'm using /Users/kichi/dev/Roo-Code-Evals/rust/gigasecond/src/lib.rs -> DateTime as an example
- revert this -- this is causing glitches in the editor window
- find another approach? can you consult rust-analyzer or rust cli tools? or does rust provide a LSP?
- btw, please remember to save all signficant prompts (i.e. the messages I entered) to prompts.md, so that we can retrace the development steps in the future. Update claude.md with detailed instructions if necessary.
- it's still not showing methods in the sidebar. can you add diagnostic messages somewhere? either inside the sidebar, or in the vscode messages window
- is it possible for you to read the diagnostic messages?
- don't use ripgrep, just use grep
- maybe vscode was blocking command execution somehow? grep also failed.
- not sure why it didn't reload this time, can you try again?
- nice, now show the full function signature (without pub fn), like `from_utc(datetime: NaiveDateTime, offset: Tz::Offset) -> DateTime<Tz>`. also why are there only 10 methods?
- linkify the function names, add show 1 line of function doc after each function
- somehow the sidebar is loading forever now
- activating extension 'undefined_publisher.rust-docs-sidebar' failed: Identifier 'lines' has already been declared
- two issues: 1. the links should open the method docs in the sidebar, 2. one-liner doc snippet not shown
- I see that the links are recognized as links (have hover indication), but clicking them don't go to anywhere. And I still don't see one-liner docs.
- still not working, please re-read /Users/kichi/.cargo/registry/src/index.crates.io-1949cf8c6b5b557f/time-0.3.44/src/primitive_date_time.rs and simulate the extraction logic and confirm that it works
- still doesn't work. maybe log the 1-liner docs in diagnostics? also why are there only 13 methods now
- it's getting better but the extracted doc is wrong. for example the full docs for as_i128 is [...] the first line should be [...] however the extracted doc is: "signs."
- this looks much better. actually instead of extracting the first line, maybe we should extract the first paragraph up to some reasonable limit (like 3 lines).
- let's commit and push for now. but note that the links are still not working
