- rename "rust-docs" to "rust-docs-sidebar"
- when the selected rust symbol is a struct, also show its methods below
- methods are not showing, I'm using /Users/kichi/dev/Roo-Code-Evals/rust/gigasecond/src/lib.rs -> DateTime as an example
- revert this -- this is causing glitches in the editor window
- find another approach? can you consult rust-analyzer or rust cli tools? or does rust provide a LSP?
- btw, please remember to save all signficant prompts (i.e. the messages I entered) to prompts.md, so that we can retrace the development steps in the future. Update claude.md with detailed instructions if necessary.
- it's still not showing methods in the sidebar. can you add diagnostic messages somewhere? either inside the sidebar, or in the vscode messages window
- is it possible for you to read the diagnostic messages?
- don't use ripgrep, just use grep
- maybe vscode was blocking command execution somehow? grep also failed.
- not sure why it didn't reload this time, can you try again?
- nice, now show the full function signature (without pub fn), like `from_utc(datetime: NaiveDateTime, offset: Tz::Offset) -> DateTime<Tz>`. also why are there only 10 methods?
